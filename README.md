Our code above shows that EEG data and predict a person's mental state by predicting a person's mental state as either negative, neutral, and positive.

Our model proves that EEG data can be used to predict mental states. This validates our research showing that by looking at theta and delta power, we can examine a person's mental state and predict whether they have suicide risk or not. This is a prototype of our model that extracts EEG data and determines an emotional state that is either negative, neutral, or positive. This code is meant to demonstrate the possibility that EEG data can determine mental states. If EEG data, can determine mental states than it proves that it's possible to examine theta and delta power, which comes from EEG data, and determine a person's suicide risk.

The dataset used for this project is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions and the data is labelled under emotions.csv. The dataset is of EEG brainwave data that has been processed by features. The set of features extracted from the EEG headband were five signals (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma). The data was collected from two people (1 male, 1 female) for 3 minutes per state - positive, neutral, negative. Six minutes of resting neutral data is also recorded, the stimuli used to evoke the emotions are below.
